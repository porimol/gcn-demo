# Demo: Application of Graph Convolutional  Networks (GCN)

In the real-world, not all the datasets fall under tabular/images. There are many important datasets come in the form of network (graph). The real-world example of the graph datasets are: social-network, knowledge base, citation network, protein-interaction networks, WWW and so on.

The goal in this presentation is to show the use case of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify nodes (papers) of Citation Network based on their features and connections in the graph.
For example, we predict the research field (label) of a paper using:
- The paperâ€™s own attributes (node features).
- Its relationships (edges) with other papers.
